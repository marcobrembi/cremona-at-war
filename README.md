# cremona at War
"Cremona at War" is a strategic mod developed for Age of History II where you can choose from four local nations: Crema, Soresina, Cremona and Casalmaggiore. Every country's population and industrial production are also as accurate as possible to offer a realistic gameplay. At the moment, this mod is a basic version, but in the future, I'm going to update it with more features. Stay Tuned!
